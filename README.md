> [!IMPORTANT]
> STyphoonm has been replaced by [MiniNT](https://github.com/ugman21/minint), Windowing System/Shell for Windows PE.

After 3 different window rendering changes (thanks robert mÃ¡slo from stackoverflow) I have now finally gotten full resizable windows (only in one corner) working.
<br>
So, im now calling this current version Milestone 1. I have other images of this before i changed the rendering (.js file is now changed as well)

## Project Info
STyphoonm is an all-web window manager that I will be working on for the next couple of months
<br>
STyphoonm will consist of web apps that function like real ones to show others that html, js and css can be valuable languages to learn in big projects
<br>
I hope that something as simple as this can turn into a fully fledged operating system with tweaks and other things.
